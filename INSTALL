Hi, Thanks for downloading the Amethyst Blog!

To install this application, please follow the following steps:

1. Download it! Which I assume you've already done....

2. Configure your database(s) in config/database.yml

3. Run 'rake db:migrate' from the command line(typically using ssh).

* Note: If you need any additional help, see the README section, it 
tells you everything you need to get started, or contact us,
