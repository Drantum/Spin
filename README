Hi! Welcome to the Readme for the Amethyst Blogging Software.
 
 Amethyst is an open source Ruby on Rails based blog. It is designed to be
 clean and intuitive, flexible, customizable, and quick. 

Features
  - Protected admin area to manage your blog securely.
  - Tagging Support
  - Post Archiving
  - Built in RSS Generator so everyone can view your latest posts.
  - Much more!

Installing 
  - Read the file INSTALL for more details. It's pretty easy!


How to use Amethyst
  - After you install amethyst, go to http://amethyst.domain.com/ to view your blog. 
    This assumes you installed amethyst to a subdomain called amethyst.domain.com. To 
    start adding posts, go to http://amethyst.domain.com/admin and log in with the 
    default username and password, which are:
     - Username: admin
     - Password: admin
    
    After you're logged in, click on any of the menu items on the top. We 
    recommend adding a post FIRST, by clicking "Add Post". It's pretty 
    self-explanatory after that. Be sure to look at all the tools you can use 
    and let us know if you need any help or have any suggestions. 

Enjoy Amethyst! Visit our site: http://www.hulihanapplications.com to let us know
about anything you're curious about or if you see any bugs/problems! We're constantly
trying to update Amethyst to make it the best open source blog ever. We can't
do that if we don't know what everyone wants, so if you see a feature you'd like, let
us know, that's what we're here for!
